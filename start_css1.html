    <h2>CSS box with a width of 300px, a border 10px wide and blue </h2> 
    <h2> this box has padding of 50px and and margin on all sides of 20px</h2>    
        <div> The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight 
            down this trench and skim the surface to this point. 
            The target area is only two meters wide. 
            It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. 
            The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. 
            A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the 
            station. 
            Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. 
            The shaft is ray-shielded, so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes. 
            That’s impossible, even for a computer. 
            It’s not impossible. I used to bull’s-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back 
            home. 
            They’re not much bigger than two meters. 
            Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
